1️⃣ What is a for loop in Python?
A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence such as a list, string, or range.

2️⃣ Difference between for and while loop?
for → used when number of iterations is known
while → used when condition is based on logic

3️⃣ What is range()?
range() generates a sequence of numbers.
syntax: range(start, stop, step)

4️⃣ Can a for loop run without range()?
Yes, it can iterate over strings, lists, tuples, and sets.

5️⃣ What is a nested for loop?
A for loop inside another for loop.

6️⃣ What is the use of break?
break stops the loop immediately.

7️⃣ What is the use of continue?
continue skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.

8️⃣ What is the difference between range(5) and range(1,6)?
Both generate numbers from 1 to 5, but:
range(5) → starts from 0
range(1,6) → starts from 1

9️⃣ Can we use else with for loop?
Yes. The else block runs if the loop completes without break.

🔟 What happens if a for loop iterates over an empty sequence?
The loop body will not execute.
